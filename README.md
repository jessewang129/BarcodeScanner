# BarcodeScanner
A hackthon project for nwHacks held at UBC on the weekend of March 13-15, 2015. 

Description:
Scans barcode to show product info and allows the user to view/add descriptions of the product 
Our original plan is to make a forum like environment where people can comment on the information regarding recycling for each product as long as they have access to the bardcode. However with time restraint and the absence of two original members we could only implement a very basic function so far.

Major contributors: 
Jesse Wang - High level design, Android platform / main API, UI design, an existing source barcode scanner API integration, posting and fetching data to a web server with our database.
YoungSeon Na - Database design / implementation, web server setup, code review, testing, and developing to follow android development standards. 
Aaron Cui - Feature design, data parsing, code review, testing, integration of an existing database's data with our own user data and database.  

Possible Future Plans:
1. Either completing the original idea, or simply use the descriptions for product review / general opinion. 
2. A voting system between users comment can help rank the order in which users can view the descriptions.
